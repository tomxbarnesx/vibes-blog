## Inspiration
I took inspiration from Twitter and general trends in short form internet writing towards snappy, snackable bites of insightful content. The exhaustive Pitchfork review feels more and more dated by the day. I aimed to create a blogging application that could speak to these trends, while nodding to the feel of a flipping through a box of records, or clicking through tracks on a digital playlist.
