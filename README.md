## Inspiration
I took inspiration from Twitter and from the general direction I see most short form internet writing taking. Snappy, snackable bites of insightful content are what publishers and users prioritize on their pages. I want to create a blogging application that could speak to those trends as well, while also nodding to the feel of a flipping through a box of records, or clicking through tracks on a digital playlist.

## Acknowledgements
Miles Davis, for the decades of inspiration he shared with the world. He appears one of my fake users, sharing his favorite 'Get Up' and 'Get Down' tracks of 2018.
